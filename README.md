The AD5293 Digital Potentiometer is an SPI, 100K-ohm device. The potentiometer sports 1024 resistance steps. The digital logic power requires 2.7v to 5.5v. The potentiometer circuit operates with dual analog supply voltages from +/-9v to +/-16.5v. The pins act similarly to a passive resistive potentiometer, but require that voltages placed on any of the three pins not exceed the analog power supply voltages.

The Cedar Grove AD5293 custom breakout board provides power and signal connections for SPI and the potentiometer chip. The AD5293 is also used in the AD9833-based Cedar Grove Precision VCO Eurorack module.
