The AD5293 Digital Potentiometer breakout board is a simple implementation of the Analog Devices' SPI, 100K-ohm chip. The potentiometer sports 10246 resistance steps and can work with a power source from +/-9V to +/-16.5V. The pins act similarly to a passive resistive potentiometer, but require that voltage placed on any of the three pins not exceed the dual power supply voltages.

A CircuitPython library is available in the code folder.
